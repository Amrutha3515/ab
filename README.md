## RISC-V RV32I

This project provides an insight into the working of a few important instructions of the instruction set of a Single cycle Reduced Instruction Set Computer - Five(RISC-V) Instruction Set Architecture suitable for use across wide-spectrum of Applications from low power embedded devices to high performance Cloud based Server processors. The base RISC-V is a 32-bit processor with 31 general-purpose registers, so all the instructions are 32-bit long. Some Applications where the RISC-V processors have begun to make some significant threads are in Artificial intelligence and machine learning, Embedded systems, Ultra Low power processing systems etc.

### FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION:

**ABOUT VERILOG**
Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language.

**ABOUT GTKWAVE**
GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ v1. 2 based wave viewer for Unix and Win32 which reads Ver Structural Verilog Compiler generated AET files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

### Installing iverilog and gtkwave
**For Ubuntu**
Open your terminal and type the following to install iverilog and GTKWave
```
$   sudo apt get update
$   sudo apt get install iverilog gtkwave
```

**To clone the repository and download the netlist files for simulation , enter the following commands in your terminal.**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vinayrayapati/iiitb_rv32i
$ cd iiitb_rv32i
```
**To simulate and run the verilog code , enter the following commands in your terminal.**
```
$ iverilog -o iiitb_rv32i iiitb_rv32i.v iiitb_rv32i_tb.v
$ ./iiitb_rv32i
```
**To see the output waveform in gtkwave, enter the following commands in your terminal.**

`$ gtkwave iiitb_rv32i.vcd`
